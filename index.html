            <p>On August 26th, 2017 I probably took the biggest of my life. I packed one backpack and one duffel, left my home in Edison, NJ, and hopped on a one way plane to the 
                hub of technology...San Francisco, California.

            <p>
                One of my biggest accomplishment's in life is graduating from Rowan University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with the status of Cum Laude. 
                Sure I did go to university to get an education, but this accomplishmnet is for my family. I'm proud to say that I am first generation graduate in my family.
